Flutter is a new mobile development SDK brought to you by Google to help build fast, beautiful, and cross-platform mobile applications. It uses a new language called Dart. Higher Wire will use a News API to fetch real time data. Firebase will be utilized on the backend and for authentication. To use this app, users will provide a one-time Google sign-in.
